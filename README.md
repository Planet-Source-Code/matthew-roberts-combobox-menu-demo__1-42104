## ComboBox Menu Demo


</div>

### Description

Demonstrates one method of creating custom menus that can contain images, combo boxes, or any other Windows control. Although this is not the most powerful method, it doesn't require any API custom calls or any third party .ocx's (like the Office Toolbar).

NOTE: This is a DEMO project. It is not a finished product. I realize that it has some pretty big limitations as it is, but it should be enough to get someone who needs to add VB controls to menus a good start. I made it simple to make it easy to understand. Please feel free to use it, modify it, and call it your own...but please don't tell me things like "It would be better if it had a calendar control" or something like that. Instead, modify it to include a date-picker, calendar control, or whatever and re-post it as an improvement. I am sure others would appreciate that and I sure won't mind.
